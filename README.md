Mini E-Learning Platform

This project is a simple prototype for a mini e-learning platform. It allows users to view a list of courses, see course details, and mark courses as completed. The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as a VibeCoding Assignment.

## Features

- View a list of at least three courses (CHM 101, MTH 101, PHY 101)
- See course details when a course is clicked
- Mark a course as "completed" with visual feedback (strikethrough)
- Course data stored in a JavaScript array (acts like a JSON object)
- No backend required—purely front-end and easy to run locally

## How to Use

1. *Clone or Download the Repository*
2. *Open the project folder*
3. **Double-click index.html** in the folder to launch in your browser
4. Interact with the course list and mark courses as completed

## Files

- index.html — Main HTML file
- style.css — Styling for the platform
- script.js — Handles logic and interactivity

## Notes

- No user login or sign-up is included (prototype simplicity)
- All course data is stored in a JavaScript array, making the app easy to extend
- Built as part of a school assignment for learning front-end development basics

Feel free to modify or extend based on your assignment instructions.
